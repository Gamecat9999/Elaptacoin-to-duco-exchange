# Elaptacoin-to-duco-exchange
This is a Simple Elaptacoin and Duinocoin exchange script that pulls up the balance of both coins and creates a exchange rate off of it. To make it functional you'll need a php host that isnt on a shared ip or the duco api wont be able to be called. Also make sure to add your credits into the config.php file
